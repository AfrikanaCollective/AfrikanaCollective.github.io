We are committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information (‘personal data’).

This policy (together with our terms of use, together with any other documents referred to in it) describes how we collect and use your personal data during your use of our site, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and associated data protection legislation.

<h2>B &emsp; Who is using your personal data?</h2>
<p/>

The Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) - Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KWTRP) is the “data controller” for the information that you provide to us when visiting this website. This means that we decide how to use it and are responsible for looking after it in accordance with the GDPR.

By visiting our site you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this policy. [Whether you can rely on consent for the processing of personal data will depend on whether the circumstances are such that the consent can be freely given (i.e. there is no imbalance in power that might make the person feel they have to consent and you are not asking for consent as an unnecessary pre-condition for a service). For further information on when it is appropriate to seek consent, please refer to the guidance on the legal basis for processing. If you are still unsure, please seek advice from the Information Compliance Team/Legal Services]

    <li/>Request correction of your data. This enables you to ask us to correct any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you.

    <li/>Request the transfer of your data to another party.
	</ul>

<p>Depending on the circumstances and the nature of your request it may not be possible for us to do what you have asked, for example, where there is a statutory or contractual requirement for us to process your data and it would not be possible to fulfill our legal obligations if we were to stop.  However, where you have consented to the processing (for example, where you have asked us to contact you for marketing purposes) you can withdraw your consent at any time by emailing us at GMbevi@kemri-wellcome.org. In this event, we will stop the processing as soon as we can.  However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before your withdrawal of consent and you may no longer be able to use the site in the same way as you did before.
